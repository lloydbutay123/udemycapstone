<p>Throughout my academic and career, I have some background in javascript, c++, databases, wiring applications like NodeRed, HTML, CSS, laravel and php. What really got me into the field, though, is the internship I did at Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company which I experienced as a customer experience service delivery associate, that's why I also have some basic background in Electronics and Electrical field.

<p>I’ve noticed that I’ve always been good with hardware, but I also want to explore different fields in programming that's why I applied here in my current Job as a Software Engineer. I also love taking photos and editing.
